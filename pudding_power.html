      <h1>Pudding Power: A Healthy Desserts Recipe App</h1>

      <p>Pudding Power is a responsive web app targeted at users that wish to find and save plant based dessert recipes, to recreate at home or with friends! In recent years, ‘home cooking’ has grown in popularity, as has a focus on health and
        plant-based foods. Researching content that is already available online, there is a vast amount of information in relation to ‘healthy’ and plant-based desserts, however a lot of content is static and or dated. In addition to this, most
        content is embedded within a wider recipe based website or web app. This indicates an opportunity to investigate further into a specific app that is wholly dedicated to healthy, plant-based desserts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>My Process</h2>
      <p>The UX design process was followed end-to-end, from initial user research, development of personas and user flows, through to narrowing down of the requirements and stories, creation of low, mid and high fidelity designs and mock ups.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>Initial research was carried out of competitor apps and websites; namely ‘Green Kitchen Stories’ and the ‘Healthy Desserts’ app. Research helped to define the problem, such as the fact there was no strong dedicated app for specifically plant
        based desserts. Any apps or websites in this area had simplistic functionality and no personalised experience such as login, share, comment and rate etc.</p>
      <p>User research also uncovered key areas user’s wanted to see from an initial release of the app; such as logging, easy search with media clips and clear imagery as well as the ability to save recipes that could easily be found again later
        on.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Ideation</h3>
      <p>Following the user research, personas were created to formalise the insights learned and present them within the context of the user: who are we designing for, what are their goals and pain points?</p>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/pudding_power/Pudding_Power_Example_Persona.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/pudding_power/Pudding_Power_Example_Persona@2x.png" alt="Pudding Power Project Personas image">
      </picture>
      <p>From this, emerged the user flows; which were key to defining the low fidelity wireframes.</p>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/pudding_power/Pudding_Power_UserFlow.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/pudding_power/Pudding_Power_UserFlow@2x.png" alt="Pudding Power User Flow image">
      </picture>
      <p>Information gathered to this point enabled formalisation of requirements, both functional and technical. Requirements were translated into the ‘User Story’ format and given a simple priority of ‘Need’ and ‘Want’. This would help define an
        MVP, where all ‘Needs’ are delivered to allow us to test the market and establish a base user group. This group of users would be able to provide insights for future testing. ‘Wants’ could be tested in the future and used to develop the
        product further.

      </picture>
      <p>Exploratory sketching was carried out following the crazy 8s method, this helped to generate a large volume of initial ideas in a short space of time. Dot voting was used to established the designs to take forward for further refinement.</p>

      </picture>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Wireframe</h3>
      <p>Following the sketching, wireframes were digitised. A second review of the designs against the user flows was carried out to ensure that these were still reflected accurately within the designs and to identify primary, secondary and tertiary
        buttons.</p>
      <p>Further design work included addition of icons and hierarchy; such as buttons, typography and layout, resulting in mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="img/Pudding_Power/Pudding_Power_LowtoMidFidelity.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
        <img src="img/Pudding_Power/Pudding_Power_LowtoMidFidelity@2x.png" alt="Pudding Power Mid-Fidelity image">
      </picture>
      <p>Once mid-fidelity wireframes were created and hierarchy established, preference testing was carried out in order help narrow down on design options, specifically regarding imagery used for the landing page. This again ensured a user centric
        design approach.</p>

      </picture>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>Outcomes of the preference testing helped to select imagery that users would prefer and further design work continued to refine elements, layout and colour scheme. To ensure consistency throughout the design process, a style guide was
        generated to capture all aspects of the design i.e. colour palette, typography, key elements, imagery and icons.</p>

        <img src="img/Pudding_Power/Pudding_Power_Styleguide@2x.png" alt="Pudding Power Style Guide image">
      </picture>
      <p>The brief stated that the solution is to be a responsive web app. With the array of screen sizes and devices that are available for today’s users, a ‘mobile first’ approach was taken to ensure we design for the lowest screen size and work
        our way up through responsive design. Several screens were designed for different breakpoints.</p>
      <picture>

        <img src="img/Pudding_power/Pudding_Power_High_Fidelity_ResponsiveMockups@2x.png" alt="Pudding Power Responsive Mockups image">
      </picture>
      <p>Once designs were high-fidelity, further feedback was requested from the team: design peers and tutor / mentors. This was an extremely valuable step as it highlighted areas of improvement. The result? Changes in colour scheme, elements and
        imagery. Keeping the style guide updated ensure consistency throughout the design. Various iterations of feedback and refinement led us to the final design....</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h3>Prototype</h3>
      <p>A low fidelity paper prototype was created during the earlier phases of the project in the hope to capture missing areas earlier rather than later. A link to the paper prototype can be <a
          href="https://invis.io/3E12MJNS6SFU#/466612405_Sign_Up" target="_blank">found here</a>.</p>
      <p>A few major errors were found! All errors were prioritised using the Nielsen Error Rating system and the higher priority ones were dealt with straight away.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>If the project were to be conducted again, then there would be more time spent on user testing, with several iterations of testing to ensure design elements, colour scheme and imagery was revised earlier on in the project. I would also do
        any usability testing with digitised wireframes rather than paper ones as although paper sketches are quick, it is also fairly quick to develop lo- fidelity wireframes in a design tool and the actual linking of screens would also be much
        quicker. Users are more likely to ‘play around’ with the prototype and provide more general feedback on the product if it were digitised I think.</p>
      <p>Also, when creating the personas, I would research more into what tools and apps are used most often, for what purpose and why, to get a better idea of designs patterns that users are familiar with using.</p>
